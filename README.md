IG to manage the FormatCode vocabulary

continuous build available at http://build.fhir.org/ig/IHE/FormatCode/branches/master/index.html

# TODO
* formal approval of this publication system (IG vs the wiki)
* publish on IHE http://profiles.ihe.net/publications/FormatCode 
* register this IG with fhir IG registry
* register this vocabulary with fhir terminology

# DONE
* Should I add to the concepts that moved to HL7 the extension replacedBy
* use IHE template -- which does work locally, but not available yet on the HL7 build machine
* Define codeSystem and valueSet with original IHE OIDs but place them into THIS IG, not MHD as they are broader than MHD
* Get all domain FormatCodes included
* Include as comment the CDA template associated with the FormatCode
