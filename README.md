# FormatCode
IG to manage the FormatCode vocabulary

continuous build available at http://build.fhir.org/ig/IHE/FormatCode/branches/master/index.html

#TODO
* Should I add to the concepts that moved to HL7 the extension replacedBy
* Is there a way the codeSystem content can be displayed in a narrative ?
* use IHE template -- which does work locally, but not available yet on the HL7 build machine
* get IHE to have a raw site on http://ihe.net/fhir to put this and other IG
